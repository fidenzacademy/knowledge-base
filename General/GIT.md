# GIT 101

> "I find your lack of knowledge in Git disturbing."
> -Darth Vader, 1980

The above took place when Lord Vader found out his colleague Motti (junior developer) didn't know [what is a VCS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and followed by a lecture about [what is Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) (while force choking him).

Git is the most important tool in a developer's arsenal. It is important to get it right at the very beginning of your journey as a developer!

## Curriculum

You might have heard and used tools such as Github Desktop, SourceTree, GitKraken, TortoiseGit, etc. All of the Git clients use the Git CLI tool under the hood. So it's better to learn that before everything else.

Make sure to go through either [Git Reference Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs) or [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/) on your own free time to learn what else Git offers.

1. [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) - Official Git basics tutorial
2. [Learn Git with BitBucket cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) - Use your basic knowledge with a cloud repository
3. [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday) - Learn few useful Git commands for everyday use
4. [Gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) - How to [ignore files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/ignoring-files) with gitignore
5. [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) - What is Git flow and how to use it

It is important to understand that following Git Flow doesn't have anything to do with `git-flow` CLI tool. We are using Git Flow as a framework to manage projects and have a standard for Git branching. Making things easier for everyone in a team.

Under the hood that tool just create, delete, etc branches for us with few different commands. You don't even need to install and use `git-flow` tool to use Git Flow.

Since now you have mastered the ways of ~~Jedi~~ Git. Feel free to use any Git client you like or stick with CLI.
